# Python Twitter Bot (Class 12 Project, 2021)

> **Note:** This project was created as a class 12 assignment in 2021. It currently requires upgrades and might not work as expected due to potential changes in Twitter's API or other dependencies.

## Description

This repository contains a Python Twitter bot that was developed as part of a class 12 project in 2021. The bot's primary purpose was to automate certain tasks on Twitter, such as posting tweets, retweeting, liking tweets, and more.

## Upcoming Upgrades

As the project was created in 2021, it might not be functional anymore due to the following reasons:

1. **Twitter API Changes:** Twitter regularly updates its API, and the current implementation might not be compatible with the latest version.

2. **Python Libraries:** The project might depend on certain Python libraries that are no longer maintained or have changed significantly since 2021.

3. **Authentication:** Twitter might have updated its authentication process, rendering the current credentials invalid.

4. **Rate Limiting:** Twitter imposes rate limits on API requests, and the bot's current implementation might not adhere to the latest rate limits.

## Planned Upgrades

In order to make the bot functional again, the following upgrades are planned:

1. **Twitter API Update:** Update the code to use the latest version of Twitter's API and ensure compatibility.

2. **Library Updates:** Replace deprecated or outdated libraries with their updated equivalents to maintain functionality.

3. **Authentication Refresh:** Obtain new API keys and tokens from Twitter to enable the bot to authenticate successfully.

4. **Rate Limit Management:** Implement rate-limiting strategies to ensure the bot doesn't exceed Twitter's API request limits.
